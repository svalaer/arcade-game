Here is how to play
--------------------------
In this game you are the player trying to reach the water! Try to cross the 3 gravel tiles and jump into the water. But beware! The path has enemies moving at random speeds from left to right. If you are hit by the enemy you will go back to the start. If you make it to the river you score 100 points!

Use your keyboards keys (as listed below) to move your character!
- 'Up': Forward
- 'Down': Backward
- 'Left': Left
- 'Right': Right

But there is a little suprise! There are 3 different types of point boosters (Heart, Key, Star) that appear randomly along the gravel path. If you collect these point boosters you will get the below points added to your score. Be patient! They do exist! But get them before the enemy or they will disappear.

- Heart : 50 points
- Key: 200 points
- Star: 300 points
